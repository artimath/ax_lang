# Axiomadic Computational Reasoning System Specification (Version 0.1.0)

## 1. Core Calculus

Axiomadic (Ax for short) is based on a dependent type theory with features from Cubical Type Theory. Its core calculus includes:

### 1.1 Types
- Basic types: Int, Float, Bool, Type, Nat
- Dependent function types (Pi types)
- Inductive data types
- Universe hierarchy: Type₀, Type₁, Type₂, ...

### 1.2 Terms
- Variables
- Lambda abstractions
- Function applications
- Let bindings
- Constructors and pattern matching
- Theorems and proofs

### 1.3 Computation Rules
- Beta reduction
- Eta conversion
- Pattern matching reduction

## 2. Type System

### 2.1 Judgments
- Γ ⊢ A : Type (A is a well-formed type in context Γ)
- Γ ⊢ t : A (t has type A in context Γ)
- Γ ⊢ A ≡ B (A and B are definitionally equal types in context Γ)
- Γ ⊢ t ≡ s : A (t and s are definitionally equal terms of type A in context Γ)

### 2.2 Inference Rules
(Detailed inference rules for type checking and equality would be provided here)

### 2.3 Cubical Features
- Path types for equality
- Compositions and filling operations
- Glue types for univalence

## 3. Parallelism and Concurrency

### 3.1 Spawn
- spawn e : Creates a new thread to evaluate e
- Type: spawn : A → Future A

### 3.2 Sync
- sync f : Waits for a future to complete and returns its value
- Type: sync : Future A → A

## 4. Inductive Types

### 4.1 Data Declarations
```ax
data TypeName (params : Params) : Type where
  Constructor1 : Type1
  Constructor2 : Type2
  ...
```

```ax
match e with
  | pattern1 => expr1
  | pattern2 => expr2
  ...

### 5.1 Theorem Declaration
```ax
theorem TheoremName : Type
```

```ax
proof
  // Proof steps
qed
```

### 5.3 Tactics
- intros: Introduce hypotheses
- apply: Apply a theorem or hypothesis
- rewrite: Rewrite using an equality
- induction: Perform induction
- reflexivity: Prove reflexive equality
- (More tactics would be defined)

## 6. Effects and Linear Types

### 6.1 Effect Declarations
```ax
effect EffectName where
  Operation1 : Type1
  Operation2 : Type2
  ...
```

### 6.2 Linear Types

- Usage tracking in type system

### 6.3 Effect Handlers
```ax
handle e with
  | Operation1 args k => expr1
  | Operation2 args k => expr2
  ...
```

## 7. Module System

```ax
module ModuleName where
  // Declarations
```

### 7.2 Imports
```ax
import ModuleName
import ModuleName (item1, item2)
```

### 7.3 Exports
```ax
module ModuleName (export1, export2) where
  // Declarations

## 8. Metaprogramming

### 8.1 Quoting
- `'e` quotes expression e

### 8.2 Splicing
- `~e` splices in a quoted expression

### 8.3 Type-Safe Macros
```ax
macro_rules! name {
  (pattern1) => {expansion1};
  (pattern2) => {expansion2};
  ...
}
```

## 9. Parallel Proof Search

### 9.1 Automatic Parallel Proof Search
```ax
